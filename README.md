## Project Requirements
The Salesboard project required us to follow a Figma design
and build the layout using CSS and HTML from scratch.
We were required to use JavaScript functions, arrays, loops
and objects to create the functionality.

## This project includes the following 'stretch goals':
  - Toggle for light and dark modes
  - Storing the data in the browser
  - Create a button to reset the data
